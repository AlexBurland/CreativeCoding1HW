Different styles of learning may affect how people percieve the difficulty of learning is. If for example someone doesn't like to read, they might automatically assume that they don't have the ability to learn through reading, but what is more likely the case is that it is effective, it is just not as entertaining to learn this way. If people put in the effort any style of learning can be just as effective as any other. In my personal opinion an equal distribution of all styles is the most effective way to study and learn. On the learning styles quiz I had 35% in two of the styles, and 30% in the other, which matches up with my beliefs that all styles are useful. Certain subjects, and even specific concepts within subjects can be taught more successfully using one method than another, or in some cases a combination of learning styles, rather than sticking to one specific style. I believe that it is the subject matter that is being taught rather than the person learning it that determines how effective using one learning style over another is.
