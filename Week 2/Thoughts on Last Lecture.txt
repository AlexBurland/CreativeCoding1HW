Randy Pausch's Last Lecture instilled within me the importance of making the most out of each day, and not allowing failure and frustration to be reason enough to give up. What stood out to me the most was that even from a young age Randy set impressive goals that may seem out of reach for most people, but his desire to succeed was greater than the oppression of effort required to make his dreams a reality. He recognized that there are things in life that are more important than his goals, namely his family. Randy was able to find the right balance for him between work, advancing his goals, and spending time with his family. His discovery and message about "head fakes" stuck out to me. I do think it's easier to trick yourself into learning a skill that you don't realize you're learning when doing another kind of work. For example, when I got my first job working in retail, I naturally improved my speaking and communication skills despite my role not directly requiring anyone to be very good at these skills. At the end of the lecture the message that all of this was a lesson for his kids really got to me. This makes the weight of his message more impactful as these are not life lessons sold to teach people how to be successful, but is his legacy that he hopes his children can use to learn and grow to live fulfilling lives. Randy's Last Lecture didn't have to be shared and made public, but he chose to do so, because he saw the value in giving anyone who wants the opportunity to hear and learn from his message the ability to do so.
