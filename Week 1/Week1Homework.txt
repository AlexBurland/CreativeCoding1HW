Graphical user interfaces and command-line interfaces offer different methods of allowing a user to interact with a system. A GUI can be easier for an inexperienced user to use, because it has the benefit of displaying icons, tooltips, and other visual elements that can help guide the user into accomplishing their desired task. On the other hand, a CLI is more beneficial for an experienced user who has learned and memorized a list of commands that can interact with the system they are working with. A CLI gives a user a greater ability to manipulate and operate by utilizing commands that aren't otherwise accessible when using a GUI. Additionally, load times are significantly shorter when using a CLI as there is no time wasted waiting for images, videos, or other graphics to render and display before the user can interact with the system. The display of a GUI is much more accommodating for someone who is inexperienced in working with computers, or who doesn't have the patience to memorize or research the commands that are necessary to work within a CLI. Learning how to navigate and use each system is necessary, because each has benefits depending on different situations.
